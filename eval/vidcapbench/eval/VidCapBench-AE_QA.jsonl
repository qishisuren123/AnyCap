Firstly, the cat's black fur takes on a deep, lustrous texture after getting wet, forming a striking contrast with the bright light under the clear sky. This contrast enhances the three-dimensionality and vitality of the scene. Secondly, the sky in the background is rendered in a bright blue, dotted with a few white clouds. This blue-and-white color scheme not only conforms to the typical representation of natural landscapes but also gives a fresh, tranquil feeling, contributing to the overall pleasant mood of the image. Moreover, the reflections and ripples on the water surface add depth and dynamism through changes and transitions in color. These reflections interact interestingly with the sky in the background, making the scene more lively and engaging.", "sub_category": "color", "primary_category": "video aesthetics"}]}
