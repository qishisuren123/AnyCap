When emergency braking is required, the braking system slows the vehicle by increasing the friction between the brake pads and the brake disc. This friction force (a product of the coefficient of friction and the normal force) is increased by hydraulically or electronically controlled mechanisms that apply greater pressure to the brake pads against the disc, thus enhancing the friction force and enabling the vehicle to stop quickly. During acceleration, torque from the electric motor or engine is transmitted to the wheels, propelling the vehicle forward. At the same time, the vehicle's acceleration performance is limited by the traction between the tires and the road surface; on wet or slippery roads, reduced traction necessitates more cautious acceleration to prevent the vehicle from skidding.", "sub_category": "common sense", "primary_category": "physical laws"}, {"question": "In which direction is the driver driving the car?", "answer": "The driver drives the car forward and then turns to the left side of the road.", "sub_category": "object motion", "primary_category": "video motion"}]}
