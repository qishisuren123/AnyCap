**Task:** You are an image-caption evaluation expert. You will be provided with a caption describing an image and a set of key points outlining important aspects of the image. Your task is to evaluate whether the caption mentions and accurately describes the given key points.
**Task Steps:**
For each key point, follow these steps:
Step 1: Check whether the key point is mentioned in the caption.
- If the key point is not mentioned, assign a score of 0.
- If the key point is mentioned (either exactly or with semantically similar phrasing), proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: Determine whether the description of the key points is correct.
- If the description aligns with or is semantically equivalent to the key point, assign a score of 1.
- If the description is incorrect, misleading, or does not accurately fit the key point, assign a score of 0.
**Evaluation Constraints:**
1. No Assumptions Beyond the Key Point: Only evaluate what is mentioned in the key point. Do not infer additional details not explicitly depicted.
2. Semantic Similarity Allowed: Phrases with similar meaning should be considered matches (e.g., "holding a ball" and "grasping a sphere").
3. Consistent Evaluation: Apply the same evaluation criteria to all key points to ensure fairness and uniformity.
**Scoring Report:**
Return the format with:

**Example Input 1:**
Key points:
mention the man's position (standing on the left side of the table)
describe the man's appearance (wearing glasses)
mention the woman's position (sitting on the right side of the table)
describe the woman's appearance (wearing a red dress)
mention the boy's position (crouching under the table)
describe the boy's action (picking up a toy)
Caption: A man stands on the left, a woman sits on the right, and a boy is under the table.

**Example Output 1:**

"key_points_scores": {
"mention the man's position": 1,
"describe the man's appearance": 0,
"mention the woman's position": 1,

"describe the woman's appearance": "Missing red dress reference",
"mention the boy's position": "Correctly mentions crouching under the table",

}
}
}

**Example Input 2:**
Key points:
describe the dog's action (chasing a ball)
mention the location (in a grassy park)
describe the weather (sunny with clouds)
Caption: A playful dog runs after a red sphere in a green field under partly cloudy skies.

**Example Output 2:**
{
"caption_evaluation": {
"key_points_scores": {
"describe the dog's action": 1,
"mention the location": 1,
"describe the weather": 1
},
"total_score": 3,
"score_reasons": {
"describe the dog's action": "Semantically equivalent to chasing a ball",
"mention the location": "Field is equivalent to grassy park",
"describe the weather": "Partly cloudy matches sunny with clouds"
}
}
}
**Input:**

{key_points}
Caption: {answer}
**Output:**
Please return the output exactly as in the example above, without adding anything else.
