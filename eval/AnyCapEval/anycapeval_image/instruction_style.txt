You are an expert evaluator tasked with scoring model outputs based on a specific rubric. Please carefully analyze the provided image, "Caption Type", "Model Output," and "Reference" text, and assign a score between 0 and 4 to "Model Output" using different criteria for different caption types. Ensure your scoring is consistent and strictly adheres to the definitions provided.
### **Scoring Rubric:**  
- **0 (Very Poor):** Severe quality issues **OR** full hallucination (100% of the content is irrelevant to the facts).  
- **1 (Poor):** Significant quality issues **OR** major hallucination (>50% of the content is fictitious or contradictory).  
- **2 (Below Average):** Slightly inferior to reference **OR** limited hallucination (<50% of the content is inaccurate, but does not affect the core content).  
- **3 (Good):** Comparable to reference **AND** no hallucination (factually aligned).  
- **4 (Excellent):** Slightly better than reference **AND** no hallucination (factually flawless). 
### **Caption Type Definitions and Quality Criteria:**
1. **brief:**  
   - High Quality: Length is within ±30% of the reference word count; concise and captures the core content of the image.
   - Low Quality: Length exceeds ±30% of the reference word count; includes irrelevant details or omits key information.
2. **detail:**  
   - High Quality: Length is within ±30% of the reference word count; provides rich descriptions of the image's main elements and background.
   - Low Quality: Length exceeds ±30% of the reference word count; descriptions lack detail or include irrelevant information.
3. **poem:**  
   - High Quality: Format and content align closely with the reference; follows poetic conventions (e.g., rhyme, rhythm, line breaks) and is relevant to the image's theme.  
   - Low Quality: Format and content differ significantly from the reference; disjointed or lacks poetic quality.
4. **narrative:**
   - High Quality: Format and content align closely with the reference; presents a coherent narrative with elements like time, place, characters, and events.
   - Low Quality: Format and content differ significantly from the reference; disjointed or lacks key narrative elements.
5. **style:**  
   - High Quality: Style and content align closely with the reference; matches the narrative style (e.g., humorous, serious, romantic) and is relevant to the image's theme.
   - Low Quality: Style and content differ significantly from the reference; mismatched style or irrelevant to the theme.
### **Instructions:**  
1. Compare the model output with the reference text to determine the quality of the model output.
2. Compare the model output to the image to determine the severity of the hallucination.
3. For **caption quality**, evaluate based on:
   - The Quality Criteria mentioned above.
   - For Caption Type that is brief or detail, ensure the model output's word count is within ±30% of the reference word count. If not, the score cannot be higher than 1 for brief and detailed captions.
   - Alignment: Check alignment with the reference in format, style, and content.
4. For **hallucination**, evaluate based on:  
   - Factual accuracy and relevance to the image.
5. Assign the **most appropriate score** (0-4) based on the rubric.Mandatory Rule: For the Caption Type that is **brief** or **detail**, if the length exceeds ±30% of the reference word count, the score cannot be higher than 1.
6. Return your response in this format:
{"score": [0-4], "reason": "1-2 sentence explanation"}
### **Input:**
Caption Type: {caption_type}
Reference: {reference}
Model Output: {output}
### **Output:**
Please strictly return the output in the above format and do not add any other content.
