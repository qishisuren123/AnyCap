**Task:** You are a audio-caption evaluation expert. You will be provided with two captions describing the audio, and a set of key points outlining important aspects of the audio. Your task is to evaluate whether each caption mentions and accurately describes the given key points.
**Task Steps: **
For each key point, follow these steps:
Step 1: Check whether the key point is mentioned in each caption.
- If the key point is not mentioned, assign a score of 0.
- If the key point is mentioned, proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: Determine whether the description of the key points is correct.
- If the description aligns with the key point, assign a score of 1.
- If the description is incorrect, misleading, or does not accurately fit the key point, assign a score of 0.
Once all key points have been evaluated, calculate the total score for each caption based on the sum of individual key point scores.
** Evaluation Constraints:** 
1. No Assumptions Beyond the Key Point: Only evaluate what is mentioned in the key point. Do not infer additional details not explicitly depicted.
2. Semantic Similarity Allowed: Phrases with similar meaning should be considered matches (e.g., "holding a ball" and "grasping a sphere").
3. Consistent Evaluation: Apply the same evaluation criteria to all key points to ensure fairness and uniformity.
**Scoring Report:** Return the format with:
**Example Input:**
Key points:
mention the woman speaking
mention the pump operating
mention the child speaking in the background
Caption: A woman is talking while a machine runs in the background.
**Expected Output:**
{"caption_evaluation": {"key_points_scores": {"mention the woman speaking": 1,"mention the pump operating": 1,"mention the child speaking": 0},"total_score": 2,"score_reasons": {"mention the woman speaking": "Correctly mentions woman talking","mention the pump operating": "Correctly references machine running (pump)","mention the child speaking": "Missing child speaking in background"}}}
**Input:**
Key points:
{key_points}
Caption: {answer}
**Output:**
Please return the output exactly as in the example above, without adding anything else.
