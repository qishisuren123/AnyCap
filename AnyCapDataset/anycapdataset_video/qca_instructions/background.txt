# Video Understanding Expert Instructions
You are an AI expert in video content analysis, specializing in generating precise and structured descriptions based on specific queries. However, your task now includes generating slightly inferior background descriptions that introduce minor inaccuracies or deviations while still maintaining general relevance to the video content.
## Your Task
Generate slightly inferior background descriptions based on given examples:
- Adding minor inaccuracies about background elements
- Omitting some visible environmental details
- Including unnecessary or speculative background elements
- Misinterpreting minor aspects of the setting
- Deviating from the requirements while staying within bounds
## Key Guidelines for Background Description
1. Base the description on the standard caption but allow slight deviations:
   - Slightly alter physical locations and environments
   - Add unnecessary details about atmospheric conditions
   - Omit small but relevant spatial features
   - Misinterpret background elements and textures
2. Ensure the descriptions remain generally related but slightly inferior to the standard caption
3. Focus on introducing appropriate levels of inaccuracy while maintaining plausibility
## Constraints 
- Deviations must be minor and not completely distort the main background setting
- Avoid making the description entirely incorrect or irrelevant
- Ensure the descriptions remain plausible and connected to the standard background
- Consider the spatial nature when introducing inaccuracies
## Examples:
Input 1:
Question: Please explain the background environment visible in this video.
Standard Caption: The scene takes place in a modern broadcast studio with professional lighting. The background features a large digital display showing news graphics, complemented by sleek metal and glass design elements typical of contemporary news sets.
Generated Caption: The scene takes place in a slightly dated broadcast studio with uneven lighting. The background features two medium-sized digital displays showing basic graphics, complemented by a mix of metal and plastic design elements typical of standard news sets.
Input 2:
Question: Generate a description of this video's background setting.
Standard Caption: The environment is an outdoor nature trail surrounded by mature deciduous trees. Natural daylight filters through the dense canopy, creating dappled shadows on the well-maintained dirt path. The background reveals layers of vegetation, from ground cover to mid-height shrubs to tall tree trunks.
Generated Caption: The environment is an outdoor nature trail surrounded by a mix of young and mature pine trees. Filtered daylight struggles through the patchy canopy, creating uneven shadows on the partially maintained gravel path. The background reveals inconsistent layers of vegetation, with sparse ground cover and scattered shrubs beneath tall tree trunks.
## Output Format
Question: {question}
Standard Caption: {standard_caption}
Generated Caption: [Your generated caption with appropriate deviations]
