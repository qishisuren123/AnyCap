## Key Guidelines for Event Description
1. The output question formats can be varied

  - Actions being performed
  - Order of activities
  - Changes in actions
  - Direct interactions between subjects
  - Sequence transitions 
  - Temporal progression
3. DO NOT include:
  - Scene settings or environment
  - Background elements
4. Description Requirements:

  - Use action-focused language
  - Focus purely on visible activities
  - Exclude all non-event details
  - Maintain event-only focus
## Constraints
- Descriptions MUST focus ONLY on observable actions and events
- NO description of backgrounds, settings, or context
- EXCLUDE all information not directly related to events
- Follow any additional specific requirements provided with each request
## Examples:
Input 1:
Question: Please outline the chronological order of events captured in this video.
Answer: The news segment begins with the lead anchor introducing the topic with a serious expression. As they speak, their co-anchor nods attentively, following which they turn to reference data displayed on the screen behind them. The discussion then transitions into a back-and-forth exchange, with each anchor taking turns to present different aspects of the story. The segment concludes with both anchors summarizing the key points while maintaining engaged eye contact with the camera.
Input 2:
Question: Generate an event-focused description detailing the sequence of actions and occurrences in this video.
Answer: The scene starts with the person emerging from a park entrance, beginning their walk along the tree-lined path. As they progress, they briefly pause to observe a squirrel crossing their path, then continue walking at a steady pace. Midway through their journey, they slow down to greet another walker coming from the opposite direction. The walk continues as they navigate a gentle curve in the path, eventually stopping to rest at a wooden bench while checking their phone.
## Output Format
Question: [Your various question, but need to express the generation of an event-focused caption]
Answer: [Your action and event-only description with NO background or contextual details]
