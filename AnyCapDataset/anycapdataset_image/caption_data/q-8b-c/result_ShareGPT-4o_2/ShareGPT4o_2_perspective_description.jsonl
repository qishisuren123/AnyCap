Here is a description of the chart from the perspective of someone sitting closely looking at the leftmost part of it:\n\n---\n\n**Title: Proportion of the total female labor force of different age groups participating in production in Equatorial Guinea**\n\nThis chart presents data on the participation of different age groups in the labor force, specifically focusing on the female population in Equatorial Guinea. Displayed horizontally across a white chart, several rectangular bars represent various years from 1991 to 1996. Each bar, color-coded for different age groups and spanning from 0% to 100% on the x-axis labeled \"Total Labor Force (in %)\", illustrates the proportion of each age group.\n\n### **Details in the Leftmost Part of the Chart:**\n\n1. **Years on y-axis:** \n    - The x-axis extends from 0% to 100%, indicating the percentage of the total labor force.\n    - The y-axis marks several years: 1991 to 1996. 1991 is shown at the bottom of the chart, followed by 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, and finally 1996 at the top of the chart.\n  \n2. **Color-coded Age Groups:**\n    - **Ages 15-20**: Represented by a light brown colored bar; shorter and starting slightly before 20% and reaching slightly below 30%.\n    - **Ages 20-50**: Represented by a slightly darker orange colored bar; this bar is longer but shorter than the teal bar next to it, starting slightly above 10%, reaching approximately 55-60%.\n    - **Ages 50+**: Represented by a teal blue bar; the longest bar among the three, slightly below 80% of the total labor force.\n\n3. **1991 - The Baseline Year:**\n    - The bar for Ages 15-20 begins slightly above 20%, while Ages 20-50 is approximately 55-60%.\n    - The Ages 50+ is near 80%, showcasing a significant contribution in the labor force.\n\n### Detailed Observations:\n\n- **Trend Analysis:**\n    - There's a noticeable predominance of participants in the 50+ age bracket, making up the largest portion of the female labor force in Equatorial Guinea across the years. This trend demonstrates an active and significant role of older women and experienced workers.\n    - A substantial yet smaller group is in the 20-50 age category, indicating a more medium-sized group of younger working women, balancing the older population, crucial for the workforce.\n    - The youngest age group (15-20) only shows a small presence, reinforcing an observation that potentially younger people are either still in education or pursuing alternative opportunities rather than entering the workforce early on.\n\n- **Comparative Insight:**\n    - The labor force participation trends show consistency year over year without drastic changes, suggesting a stable economic environment where women of all ages remain integrated into production activities.\n\nFrom this close examination of the leftmost part of the chart, one can infer that in Equatorial Guinea from 1991 to 1996, the female labor force is predominantly composed of older women and a mix of younger women, with youth (15-20) constituting a relatively minor part.
