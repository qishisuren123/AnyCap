The shark's skin has a unique pattern of light spots and stripes across its back, which contrasts against a darker bluish-gray background. This pattern is a characteristic feature of whale sharks, each with a unique design, much like a fingerprint.\n\nIn the image, the whale shark is shown swimming alongside a diver, offering a clear perspective on its enormous size compared to a human. Its broad, flat head and wide mouth are visible, which are typical attributes of whale sharks. Unlike other sharks with more pointed heads, the whale shark's broad head helps facilitate its filter-feeding practice. The overall shape of its body is streamlined, accentuated by its broad, lateral pectoral fins and a prominent dorsal fin.\n\nNotable qualities of the whale shark include its gentle nature, as it poses no threat to humans. As filter feeders, they primarily consume plankton and small fish by swimming with their mouths open. Despite their massive size, whale sharks are known for their slow and graceful swimming behavior. The presence of the diver and multitude of smaller fish around it highlights its non-aggressive, serene presence in the ocean ecosystem."}], "id": 828, "width": 2048, "height": 1536}
